    <h2>The beginning</h2>
     &nbsp;
    <h4>Established in 1980, Ornitor SRL is a state and federally licensed zoological facility and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
    Originally started outside Toowoomba, Ornitor SRL soon moved to Tasmania, where there was more room for the animals, and to provide for future expansion
    The Sanctuary was not open to the public at that time, but did allow supporters and their guests who wanted to learn about platypuses to visit on special occasions.  By 2001 the Sanctuary knew the overall need for educating the public had begun to outweigh its desire to remain closed to public visitation.  As such, Sanctuary management and Board of Directors agreed to build an initial elevated walkway and observation deck so that interested people and the general public could begin visiting on a regular basis.

    <h2>What we do</h2>
    &nbsp;
    <h4>At Ornitor SRL, the animals come first! Providing expert care and rehabilitation, exceptional diets and enrichment, and large spaces in which to roam make life for our rescued animals the kind of life they would have if they could choose it.
    Older platypuses that are too weak, or are in need of special medical attention, still come to the Sanctuary where they can be closely monitored. Younger, and more healthy platypuses currently go directly to the Refuge.

    <h2>Now</h2>
     &nbsp;
    <h4>Since 2001, the Sanctuary has been open daily from 9:00 AM to Sunset, except for major holidays and during bad weather.
    The Sanctuary remains located on rural, rolling grasslands northeast of Hobart. Currently, this facility occupies 789 acres and shelters more than 550 platypuses. It still remains the first sanctuary of its kind to create large acreage species-specific habitats for rescued platypuses.</h4>
